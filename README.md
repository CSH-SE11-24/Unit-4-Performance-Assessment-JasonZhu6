The index.html is the description of this website. There are also some brief definition about the types of animals under the description. At the very end, there's a "searching animal based on letter" section as well. 

On the viviparity.html, it's all about animals that are born-lived. In this page, there's a definition of what viviparity is, and some examples following the definition. 

On the oviparity.html, it's all about animals that are born as a egg. In this page, there's a definition of what oviparity is, and some examples following the definition. 

Using Bootstrap allows me to build my website without having to start from the foundation. I can just take the pieces they have already designed and put my site together like Legos.

I can follow my MVP plan well enough to build my site because I know what I need to add to my site from the plan first.

Personally, my favorite feature is my intro card to my website. I think it looks the most like a section you can see on other sites.

If I had more time, I would expand on the section on sorting animals by letter below the introduction to my website. I can add all the letters instead of just 4.
